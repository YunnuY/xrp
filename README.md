==========================
i was interested in creating a full-stack javascript web framework [MEEN](https://github.com/YunnuY/meen)
which use nodejs as backend and emberjs as frontend, then find that there has been
a good solution [sane](https://github.com/artificialio/sane) as well as its  official demo app [how-to-sane](https://github.com/mgenev/how-to-sane).

1. i want a dedicated place to discuss node, sailsjs, emberjs and sane;
2. i want to show some real usecase for sane as well as sailsjs, emberjs;
3. i happen to have a domain name getxrp.com;

so i decide to develop an bbs using sane stack. thanks to how-to-sane as some ideas come from it.
